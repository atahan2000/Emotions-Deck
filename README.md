# Emotions-Deck
My first time usage of NanDeck for making deck for individual purposes.

### Things to remind myself:
1. Output pdf should be mirror in order for printer to swap.
2. I should have added more borders and distance between cards.
3. The cards should have been in the middle of the page not upper left.


### Material I used:
1. 160g Paper
2. PVC Lamination

### Software
I used NanDeck to create these pdf's. The txt folder contains the code for it. I had to use wine in order to open .exe file for the nandeck.
